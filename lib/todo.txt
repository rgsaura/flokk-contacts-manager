// TODO: COLEMAN
 * [x] Edit Panel - Finish Picture Upload (ContactEditPanel.handlePhotoPressed)
 * [x] Edit Panel - Add Label selector (ContactEditPanelView)
  * Will need to use a 'MiniForm'. Tricky to understand, but pretty easy to use
  * Lots of examples in /miniforms
  * Key thing is that the 'MiniForm' needs to dispatch up a FocusChangedNotification upwards, as Focus changes on it's own children
 * [x] Update StyledScrollBar + List to support horizontal scrolling
 * [x] Add 'smokeTest' NativeExtension Spike so we can easily test different platforms
  * [x] Should let us test everything that gets touched when we upgrade SDK (Display AppData folder, Test all extensions, etc)
 * [x] Add All Icons (when ready from design)
 * [x] Fix padding on bottom of label header in search dropdown
 * [x] Search hscroll should not include icons
 * [x] Update search filtering
 * [x] Line in label miniform
 * [x] Label MiniForm should close suggestions when not focused
 * [x] Focus label miniform text field after adding a new label
 * [x] Get clipping and animation into the splash screen
 WED
 * [x] Splash screen is getting clipped at certain resolutions
        * make a spike with just the splash screen, and test it thoroughly
 * [x] Fix search hotkey kicking you out of fields
 * [x] Label Miniform should not close after clicking a label

 THUR
 * [x] Use solid background colors for avatars instead of images
 * [x] Search should not show results as suggestions
 * [ ] Code cleanup
 * [ ] Polish and Tune Tab Navigation across the app, with a focus on Dashboard. Ideally can navigate from right to left, across the whole app.

 FRI
 * [ ] Dropdown tabbing
 * [ ] Talk to Yoon and figure out what we want to do with mouse-over/shadows on the various Dashboard Cards


/////////////////////////////////////////////////
// TODO EDDIE

* Optimize service calls, lets start counting them, making sure we're optimizing

* Examine startup time, it's getting quite long with the social accts in.
    * Get a breakdown of where the time is going, and see what we can do?

* Make sure nothing can break app startup, throw everything we can at the loading

* Impose low-level social refresh rates at the command layer
  * Twitter - 1m refresh limit
  * Git - 5m for events, 72 hrs for repo info
  * Global Contacts Refresh - 20s
  * Git timeouts should be respected on startup (mainly with regards to repo info)
  * The idea with implementing it at a low level, is:
      * we can can be kinda sloppy with our command calls from the UI (like double-loading on startup),
      * we know they are basically cached calls, won't slow down the app or waste service calls
